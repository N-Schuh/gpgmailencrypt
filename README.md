# gpgmailencrypt
gpgmailencrypt can encrypt e-mails.
It supports
* PGP/Inline
* PGP/Mime

It can be used normally as a script doing everything on command line or in daemon mode, where gpgmailencrypt acts as an encrypting smtp server. 
It takes emails and if a encryption key exists for this user it will return the e-mail encrypted to another e-mail server. 
The encryption method can be selected per user.
